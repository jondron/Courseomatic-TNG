# Courseomatic
 A javascript app to develop course storyboards

 This is a single-user app needs no server to run: changes are saved locally and can be exported and imported via JSoN files but only one person can work on a course design. 
 A multi-user version may be developed later but, for now, the assumption is that it will be used by a single course designer, ideally in collaboration with a team, but there is one and only one master copy.

 Its purpose is to develop learning designs for courses. You can create courses that contain units that contain learning activities, with a simple graphic display using a card interface to represent
 each activity.
 Along the way you associate activity learning outcomes with course learning outcomes, estimate study hours, and, if the activity is tagged as an assessment, enter information about that assessment
 including anticipated marking hours.

 The app automatically calculates total study hours and total marking hours, shows proportions of time spent on different learning activity types, identifies outcomes that have not yet
 been assessed, and can generate a full course outline that can be used to develop the course itself.
 
 The learning activity types are based on ABC Learning Design activity types, with the addition of reflection and cooperation to better support self-paced study 
 (you don't have to use those if you don't like them).
